## 🚀 Live Application

🔗 **Frontend (React + Vite)**  
👉 https://phishscan.vercel.app/

🔗 **AI Engine (FastAPI)**  
👉 Secure backend microservice

---

## 🧠 Why PhishShield?

Traditional phishing systems rely on:
- Static rules
- Blacklists
- Keyword matching

❌ These approaches fail against:
- AI-generated phishing emails  
- Brand impersonation & typosquatting  
- Malware-based attacks  
- Psychological social engineering  

✅ **PhishShield solves this by combining AI + reasoning.**

> **AI predicts. The security engine decides.**

## 🔐 Core Features (Implemented)

### 🧠 AI-Based Email Content Analysis
- Transformer-based phishing classifier (BERT)
- Context-aware NLP analysis
- Resistant to obfuscation and AI-generated attacks

---

### ⚖️ Hybrid Risk Scoring Engine
- Combines:
  - AI confidence score
  - URL intelligence
  - Attachment threat analysis
  - Header authentication
  - Behavioral heuristics
- Hard security overrides
- Aggressive false-positive reduction

---

### 📎 Advanced Attachment Intelligence
- Detects:
  - Executable malware (`.exe`, `.js`, `.bat`)
  - Double-extension attacks (`invoice.pdf.exe`)
  - Suspicious compressed files
- Produces structured attachment threat reports

---

### 🌐 URL & Link Intelligence
- Suspicious TLD detection
- IP-based URLs
- Redirect tricks (`@`)
- Credential harvesting patterns
- Brand misuse detection inside URLs

---

### 🧾 Sender & Header Authentication
- SPF/DKIM-style validation
- `From` vs `Signed-By` mismatch detection
- Free email impersonation detection
- Authentication failure escalation

---

### 🧠 Brand Impersonation & Typosquatting Detection
- Detects look-alike domains:
  - `paypa1`, `g00gle`, `micros0ft`
- Fuzzy brand similarity logic
- Corporate identity abuse detection

---

### 🔍 Explainable AI Output
Each scan provides:
- Risk level (Low / Medium / High)
- Confidence score
- Detected issues
- Human-readable security recommendations

---

## 📊 Sample Threat Output
PHISHING THREAT DETECTED
Confidence: 90%

Issues:
• Dangerous executable attachment
• Brand impersonation detected
• Header authentication failed

Action:
Delete immediately. Do not open attachments or click links.
