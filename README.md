## 🚀 Live Application

🔗 **Frontend (React + Vite)**  
https://phishscan.vercel.app/

🔗 **AI Engine (FastAPI)**  
Secure Python-based microservice

## 🧠 Why PhishShield?

Traditional phishing detection systems rely on:
- Static rules
- Keyword matching
- Blacklists

❌ These methods fail against:
- AI-generated phishing emails
- Brand impersonation & typosquatting
- Malware-based attachment attacks
- Psychological social-engineering techniques

✅ **PhishShield combines AI with decision-level security reasoning.**

> **AI predicts the threat.  
The cognitive security engine decides the response.**

## 🔐 Core Features (Implemented)

### 🧠 AI-Based Email Content Analysis
- Transformer-based phishing classifier (BERT)
- Context-aware NLP understanding
- Resistant to obfuscation and AI-generated attacks

### ⚖️ Hybrid Cognitive Risk Engine
- Combines:
  - AI confidence score
  - URL intelligence
  - Attachment threat analysis
  - Sender & header authentication
  - Behavioral heuristics
- Hard security overrides
- Aggressive false-positive reduction

### 📎 Advanced Attachment Intelligence
- Detects:
  - Executable malware (`.exe`, `.js`, `.bat`)
  - Double-extension attacks (`invoice.pdf.exe`)
  - Suspicious compressed files
- Generates structured attachment threat reports
- Designed for VirusTotal, ClamAV & sandbox integration

### 🌐 URL & Link Intelligence
- Suspicious TLD detection
- IP-based URLs
- Redirect tricks (`@`)
- Credential harvesting patterns
- Brand misuse detection inside URLs

### 🧾 Sender & Header Authentication
- SPF/DKIM-style validation
- `From` vs `Signed-By` mismatch detection
- Free email impersonation detection
- Authentication failure escalation logic

### 🧠 Brand Impersonation & Typosquatting Detection
- Detects look-alike domains:
  - `paypa1`, `g00gle`, `micros0ft`
- Fuzzy brand similarity analysis
- Corporate identity abuse detection

### 🔍 Explainable AI Output
Each scan provides:
- Risk level (Low / Medium / High)
- Threat confidence score
- Detected security issues
- Human-readable recommendations

---

## 📊 Sample Threat Output

PHISHING THREAT DETECTED
Confidence: 90%

Detected Issues:
• Dangerous executable attachment
• Brand impersonation detected
• Header authentication failed

Recommended Action:
Delete immediately. Do not open attachments or click links.
